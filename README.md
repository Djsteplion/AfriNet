# *"AFRI-NET"*  
is  a web  solution , aimed at helping people across Africa to access any content of their choice on the internet with their local language/ tongue , especially those who don't understand or speak English language, without having to search  for physical or online translators.

Research has shown that over 3.5  billion people possess digital devices that can access the internet. And there are over 6,000 languages  in the world.

The aim of AFRI-NET  is to help users overcome the barrier of language when accessing the net, by making use of generative Ai. Millions of  users have had to use different  online language  translators; most of which were not effective , when accessing certain contents on the web. This has affected a lot of online businesses, and digital economy of many countries. Some countries could have made more money online , if their citizens ( those who only understood the local  languages ), had access to information on the web in their local language (not restricted to ecommerce,  advertisement, B2B, e.t.c).
The same applies internationally. For example,  I have come across many Japanese ecommerce websites that used Japanese language as the primary language on their website..


To this end, AFRINET aims  to eradicate this barrier,  and create a win-win solution for all concerned individuals and organisations.
